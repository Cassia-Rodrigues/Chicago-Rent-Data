# Chicago-Rent-Data
By leveraging historical data, advanced analytical techniques, and econometric modeling, we seek to address key questions that are top of mind for our readers:
1. What are the expected trends and patterns in rental housing prices in the Chicago area over the
coming years?
2. How reliable are the forecasts for rental housing prices?
3. What implications do the projected rent price trajectories have for investors, renters,
policymakers, and other stakeholders in the Chicago rental market?
